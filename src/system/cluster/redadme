clustering :

the current  cluster logic is used to create sticky session between the primary process and the workers using socket emit's and the heart beats from worker
to primary

primary will manage the workers ( fork / restart / kill )
worker weill handle the worker-app logic that runs the fastify server so every worker will run a fastify app on his own

master will run the server
